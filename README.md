# KEVN Test and Demo Repo

Contains test and demo materials for [KEVN](https://github.com/rabbitboots/kevn).


## Setup

* Copy `kevn.lua` to: `./kevn/kevn.lua`

* LÖVE tests: move to base test directory and launch LÖVE: `love . [req.path.to.test_file]`

* Lua tests: run `lua <test_file_name.lua>`

Lua files beginning with `l` can be run with Lua from the CLI. You can also run them through LÖVE, though the only output will be to the console and they will terminate immediately.


## Tests

**TODO**: *LÖVE-specific examples.*


### ltest.lua

A general test of KEVN features and non-fatal errors.
